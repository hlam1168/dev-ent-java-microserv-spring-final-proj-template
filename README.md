# Sprint Boot microservices final project

This project uses a Spring Framework for manipulatiing an alumni record in a database. Two REST API microservices that follow the SOLID principles are created. One API is used to show all records of alumni.  Another one API is used to add an alumni record.
1. /printAllAlumni with GET method to show all alumni records
1. /addAlumni	with POST method to add one alumni record
The microservices interact with a table in MySQL database.
